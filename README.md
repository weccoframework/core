# wecco

`wecco` is a Web Framework based on web standards such as [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/), 
[HTML Templates](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) and plain JavaScript that features

* simplicity
* performance
* small footprint

`wecco` features a _functional programming style_ as opposed to a class based approach using inheritence that other common web frameworks endorse. Using functions to express a dynamic web UI allows a developer to focus on a descriptive approach, where as classes tend to obfuscate the concepts behind a dynamic UI.

`wecco` is written using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The type definitions allow an IDE to provide valuable hints of function's parameters and return types. Nevertheless `wecco` can be used with plain Javascript as well.
